* My goal is to become a frontend developer in 1 year. I am planning on doing that by practicing every day, being hard-working and persistent.
* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.
* Code example:
```
//This function should return n!
function factorial (n) {
    if (n < 0)
    return null;

    if (n === 0 || n === 1)
    return 1;

    for (let i = n; i > 1; i--) {
      n = n * (i - 1);
    };
  return n;
  }
```
* I have a bachelor degree in Economics and master degree in Management from Novosibirsk State University. Was studying 1 semester in Spain (Universidad de Cadiz). In 2021 finished Web Developer Course made by Rob Percival.
